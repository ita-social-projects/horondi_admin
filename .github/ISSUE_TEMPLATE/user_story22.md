**User Story.** Record format selection

AS an application user

I WANT TO be able to choose recording format between different types (.wav, .mp3, .wma)

SO THAT I can make superior quality recordings if needed, or I can save space on my smartphone if low record will be acceptable for my purposes

**Scenario:** User changes recording format

**GIVEN:** I am an application user and I am on start application screen

**WHEN** I click sound quality icon at the bottom right corner (SQ, HQ ,LQ)

**THEN** system shows me a screen where I can change type of my recording between 3 formats:

**SQ** – Superior quality (.wav)
**HQ** – High quality (.mp3)
**LQ** – Low quality (.wav)

And **WHEN** I made my choice
**THEN** system saves it, and takes me back on start screen and the icon at the bottom right corner changes, based on which format I choose (SQ, HQ, LQ)
